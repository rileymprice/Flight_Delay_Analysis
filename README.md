# Flight_Data_2018_April
*Background: After flying many times over the 2 years since moving to the NYC area, I find that my flights are consistently delayed. I am interested to see if I am an outlier and if there is one airline that experiences more delays than others. 

*Goal: Search to see if there is a particular location, time, or airline that has more delays than average.
